            <p>
                Assassin's Creed II is a 2009 action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montréal and published by Ubisoft.[1] It is the second major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and the sequel to 2007's Assassin's Creed. The game was first released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2009, and was later made available on Microsoft Windows in March 2010 and OS X in October 2010. Several minor game-related features could be redeemed on Uplay and three downloadable expansion packs, including two story expansions, were released on Xbox Live and later to other platforms. A three-part live-action short film, titled Assassin's Creed: Lineage, which serves as a prequel to the main story and stars most of the game's cast, was produced and released on YouTube to promote it ahead of release.
